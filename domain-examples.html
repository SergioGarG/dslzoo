<h1>Robotics DSL Zoo</h1>

<h2>Domain Example</h1>

<table><tr><td> <i> (to be <a href="./contribute.html">extended</a> ...)</i></p>

    <p style="float:left;">
To exemplify the domain of this Robotics DSL Zoo we use the Precision Placement Test (PPT)
from the <a href="http://www.robocupatwork.org/">RoboCup@Work</a> competition.
It is a new competition in RoboCup that targets the use of robots in industrial
scenarios where robots cooperate with human workers and machines for complex tasks ranging from 
manufacturing, assembly, automation, and parts-handling up to general logistics. 
The PPT exemplifies the complexity and huge variability of competences and 
capabilities required to develop today's robot applications.
We consider this example to represent the current state of the art involving
mature robotics disciplines so that we expect to find consolidated knowledge in
the form of DSLs.</p>
    <img src="images/pptPlatform.jpg" title="Precision Placement Test (PPT) in RoboCup@Work" width="25%" style="float:right;" />


<p>In the following we will explain the PPT and also synthesize a core set of
subdomains which are relevant in solving the task and are used 
used for classification of the collecteded publications. We are aware that this list is non-conclusive, but focus
on these for the sake of brevity.
The main objective of the PPT is to assess the robot's ability to grasp and 
place objects into object-specific cavities (see image to the right). The 
objects are taken from a set of (a priori known) standardized industrial objects 
such as screws, nuts, bolts and profiles. For the test a single robot is placed
in front of a service area which stores the objects to be manipulated. The
objective is to pick each object and place it in the corresponding cavity. Once
the objects are picked up and placed or the time is over the task ends.</p>


<p>To simulate and solve the problem one usually first needs to know the
<a href="robot-structure-subdomain.html">Robot Structure</a> of the target robot platform. This comprises representation of the 
actual physical realization of robot platforms (e.g., mobile base and 
manipulator) in terms of their mechanical structure and kinematic as well as 
dynamic properties. This subdomain roughly corresponds to Part B of Springer 
Handbook of Robotics (<i>Robot Structures</i>).
Furthermore, <a href="transformation-subdomain.html">Coordinate Representations and Transformations</a>
between parts of the robot and its environment are required to enable computation
of  position, force, and velocity of the robot joints. This subdomain 
roughly corresponds to Part A in the Handbook of Robotics (<i>Robotics 
Foundations</i>). Exemplary DSL representatives for this subdomain are 
URDF and the work of <a href="transformation-subdomain.html#Frigerio2011">Frigerio et al.</a>.</p>


<p>In general, the PPT demands advanced <a href="perception-subdomain.html">Perception</a> and 
<a href="reasoning-and-planning-subdomain.html">Reasoning and Planning</a> abilities, namely to recognize and
match objects and the correct cavities. Further, precise <a href="manipulation-and-grasping-subdomain.html">Manipulation and
Grasping</a> abilities are required, namely to grasp and place the
object in such a manner that it fits into the cavity.
These subdomains roughly correspond to Part C (<i>Sensing and 
Perception</i>), Part A Chapter 9 (<i>AI Reasoning Methods for Robotics</i>), and 
Part D Chapter 28 (<i>Grasping</i>) in the Handbook of Robotics.</p>

<p>For each sub-task (object/cavity <i>detection/recognition</i> and object 
<i>manipulation</i>) there are several options to approach the problem which all 
require <a href="coordination-subdomain.html">Coordination</a> primitives such
as finite-state machines. For instance, the placement of objects in the cavities 
can be achieved through first perceiving and computing the position of the 
cavities and then generating a plan yielding a pose where the object can be 
dropped in the cavity. A more control-based approach is to compute an 
approximately position of the cavity and then placing the object on the arena 
and sliding the object into the cavity by means of force-feedback. 
This approach demands advanced <a href="motion-control-subdomain.html">Motion Control</a> abilities in 
order to cope with uncertainties in the environment and fulfill
constraints such as force-limits which corresponds to roughly to Part A 
Chapter 7 (<i>Force Control</i>) in the Handbook for Robotics. Example DSLs for
this task are <a href="motion-control-subdomain.html#Klotzbuecher2011">TFF</a> and <a href="motion-control-subdomain.html#Vanthienen2013">iTaSC</a>. The
presented capabilities all need to be integrated in an overall
<a href="architecture-subdomain.html">Architecture</a> with <a href="components-subdomain.html">Components</a> as the basic
building blocks which are preferable re-usable also for other applications.
This domain corresponds roughly to Part A Chapter 8 (<i>Robotic Systems
Architectures and Programming</i>) in the Handbook of Robotics. <td/><td>   </td></tr></table></div>
